## welcome to ParkerAI ðŸ‘‹

The project enhances urban mobility by detecting parking occupancy with real-time alerts. 
It uses Kubernetes microservices, load balancer and machine learning (PyTorch, OpenCV). 
The MERN stack, built with Material UI and Redux Toolkit, supports server-side pagination and aggregation for efficient queries. 
An API manages data and authentication, while a Python-Telegram GUI enables user interaction.
