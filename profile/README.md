## welcome to ParkerAI ðŸ‘‹

the project aims to improve urban mobility by identify whether parking spaces are unoccupied/occupied and to alert users.
It uses a server application that processes real-time data from parking lots, employing machine learning (PyTorch) and computer vision (OpenCV) to predict occupancy. 
The system includes an API for data flow control and client authentication, along with a Python-Telegram GUI client for end-user data consumption.
The project integrates machine learning with web technologies for a smart parking solution, utilizing Express.js and Node.js for server and API development, and Python for client-side interactions.
